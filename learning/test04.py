string1 = "Hello "
string2 = "Yoloman!"

# string3 = string1.extend(string2) => does not work, but i thought a string is the same like an array. There is a workaropund wich not makes sense here but i could make an array out of the strings, then extend one with the other and then parse it back to string but anyway

print(string3)
